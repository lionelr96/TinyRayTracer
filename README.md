# TinyRayTracer

This is an incredibly simple ray tracer only capable of rendering 3D images. At this time it will only be able to render spheres. The ray tracing algorithm used is the original Whitted algorithm first published in 1979 in the paper "An improved illumination model for shaded display". This is a simplistic implementation of that algorithm using only ray-sphere intersection. Eventually I may add other features and maybe other sorts of intersections if I have the time or interest.

More to come...
